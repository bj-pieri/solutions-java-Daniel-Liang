2.1
(Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit) Write a program that reads a Celsius degree in a
double value from the console, then converts it to Fahrenheit, and displays the
result. The formula for the conversion is as follows:
fahrenheit = (9 / 5) * celsius + 32
Hint: In Java, 9 / 5 is 1, but 9.0 / 5 is 1.8.

```
Enter a degree in Celsius: 43.5
43.5 Celsius is 110.3 Fahrenheit

2.12 (Physics: finding runway length) Given an airplane’s acceleration a and take-off
speed v, you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to
take off using the following formula:

lenght = v² / 2a 

Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and
the acceleration a in meters/second squared (m/s2), then, displays the minimum
runway length.
```
Enter speed and acceleration: 60 3.5
The minimum runway length for this airplane is 514.286

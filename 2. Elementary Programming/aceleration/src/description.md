(Physics: acceleration) Average acceleration is defined as the change of velocity
divided by the time taken to make the change, as given by the following formula:

a = (v1 - v0) / t

Write a program that prompts the user to enter the starting velocity v0 in meters/
second, the ending velocity v1 in meters/second, and the time span t in seconds,
then displays the average acceleration. 

Here is a sample run:

```
Enter v0, v1, and t: 5.5 50.9 4.5
The average acceleration is 10.0889
